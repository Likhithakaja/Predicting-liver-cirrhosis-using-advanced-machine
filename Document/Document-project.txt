Internship Title: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Project Title: Predicting Liver Cirrhosis Using Advanced Machine Learning
Intern Name: Likhitha.Kaja
Duration: [19-05-2025] – [30-06-2025]
Organization: SmartBridge
1. Project Overview
Liver cirrhosis is a severe and progressive condition affecting liver function. This project involves developing a machine learning-based prediction model that identifies patients with liver cirrhosis based on a set of clinical and biochemical parameters. The system leverages AI/ML models to analyze patient data and classify whether the individual is likely to suffer from liver cirrhosis.

 2. Objectives
To create a predictive model for early diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.
To analyze the correlation between clinical parameters and disease occurrence.
To evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms.
To support medical practitioners with data-driven tools for diagnosis.
